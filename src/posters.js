Features like edge computing, network slicing, and better and more flexible radio connectivity can be used to support qualitatively different applications.  Nevertheless, the challenges to be overcome in order to realize this connectivity/computing convergence are still notable. In particular, the increasing number of control and optimization dimensions of the end-to-end 5G infrastructure may result in an overly complex network that operators and vendors may find difficult to operate, manage, and evolve. The introduction of AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies in the cloud-network convergence process will be crucial and help operators achieve a higher level of automation and increase network performance.

Models can also become exceptionally large with GPT-3 weighing in at some 700 GB and Google Brain being almost ten times that size. With those compute requirements come large power requirements; the compute resources used for training the GPT-3 model correspond to close to 1GWh of electricity which, if generated by a coal fired power plant leads to the emission of close to 1000 metric tons of CO2.\nThe large compute requirements are caused by a combination of the considerable number of parameters of the models, the large amount of data used for training and the iterative nature of the training process (many small updates to the model parameters to gradually improve the results on the training set).\nWhen the model has been trained, it can be used for inference. For instance, a model trained to drive a vehicle using photos and videos of traffic situations is used to drive. Here, the compute demands are smaller since just a single input at a time is used rather than a large training set and each input is used once rather than many times to gradually adjust parameters. But resource demands may still be problematic since inference may occur in a more constrained environment, such as in a vehicle rather than in a data centre, and the acceptable latency may be a fraction of a second for each input rather than several days for the whole training process.

Research in this field has become increasingly important in recent years. Smart and connected devices are continuously being adopted and more widespread, and the equipped sensors are improving and collecting a lot of data at a fast pace, which gives rise to a need for algorithms that can efficiently handle the large volumes of distributed data. \nFederated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework where a central server orchestrates the training of clients to learn a model on decentralized data. This entails several questions, and many challenges have emerged that are expected to grow in the near future.\nHowever, a central server might not always be available or even desirable, as it can be a large bottleneck or a possible source for malicious attacks. Decentralized machine learning is a research field addressing such problems. The aim of this PhD project is to study challenges and advance the research in both federated and decentralized learning. Open problems in these fields include developing algorithms for data heterogeneity, personalization, efficient communication, model compression and many more.', 'links': '', 'contact': 'Edvin Listo Zec', 'tags': ['datascience', 'ai'], 'teams': 'common_team_link'}, {'title': 'Resource-Efficient Multlingual NLP', 'text': 'Natural language processing (NLP) is the computational processing of human language, with applications such as machine translation, summarization and question answering. Like all areas of AI, NLP has witnessed tremendous progress in recent years through the development of complex neural network models that can learn effectively from very large amounts of data. Models like GPT-3 with billions of parameters, trained on terabytes of language data, exhibit unprecedented language processing capabilities and make headline news, but they also present important challenges. How can we make resource-efficient NLP available in situations where we do not have access to super-computers? And how can we deliver high-quality NLP for languages with more limited resources than English and a few other languages, so that a larger part of the world’s population can benefit from the technology? A promising approach to the second problem is to train multilingual models on data from multiple languages, hoping that the languages will mutually reinforce each other. Unfortunately, the effect observed has often been the opposite, with suboptimal performance compared to monolingual models, especially for low-resource languages, and with quality decreasing as more and more languages are added, an effect that has become known as “the curse of multilinguality”. In this project, we explore modularization and model compression as key techniques for making multilingual NLP models more effective, by delivering higher quality for more languages, and more efficient, by requiring less resources to deliver these results.', 'links': '', 'contact': 'Joakim Nivre', 'tags': ['datascience', 'ai'], 'teams': 'common_team_link'}, {'title': 'Cross-lingual transfer of monolingual models, poster', 'text': 'Recent studies in cross-lingual learning using multilingual models have cast doubt on the previous hypothesis that shared vocabulary and joint pre-training are the keys to cross-lingual generalization.
