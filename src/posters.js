Features like edge computing, network slicing, and better and more flexible radio connectivity can be used to support qualitatively different applications.  Nevertheless, the challenges to be overcome in order to realize this connectivity/computing convergence are still notable. In particular, the increasing number of control and optimization dimensions of the end-to-end 5G infrastructure may result in an overly complex network that operators and vendors may find difficult to operate, manage, and evolve. The introduction of AI and Machine Learning technologies in the cloud-network convergence process will be crucial and help operators achieve a higher level of automation and increase network performance.

Models can also become exceptionally large with GPT-3 weighing in at some 700 GB and Google Brain being almost ten times that size. With those compute requirements come large power requirements; the compute resources used for training the GPT-3 model correspond to close to 1GWh of electricity which, if generated by a coal fired power plant leads to the emission of close to 1000 metric tons of CO2.\nThe large compute requirements are caused by a combination of the considerable number of parameters of the models, the large amount of data used for training and the iterative nature of the training process (many small updates to the model parameters to gradually improve the results on the training set).\nWhen the model has been trained, it can be used for inference. For instance, a model trained to drive a vehicle using photos and videos of traffic situations is used to drive. Here, the compute demands are smaller since just a single input at a time is used rather than a large training set and each input is used once rather than many times to gradually adjust parameters. But resource demands may still be problematic since inference may occur in a more constrained environment, such as in a vehicle rather than in a data center, and the acceptable latency may be a fraction of a second for each input rather than several days for the whole training process.
