Even if this is true, there will always be situations where it is hard or impractical to use the largest models.

The ongoing discussion is now about how these can become even more efficient and even integrated parts of the energy system. The energy use of the facility envelope is still 10-20% of the data center total energy use. The remaining 80-90% come from the software applications running on the servers, which also need optimization. A holistic view on the energy efficiency of the total IT infrastructure is needed.", link: "https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NzQxMGYxMGYtOGNmNy00MTRmLTg2OGMtYzcyNzNmNWQ1OGQ0%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%225a9809cf-0bcb-413a-838a-09ecc40cc9e8%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22d8aaa3f7-c388-4111-ab10-c711cf05e49d%22%7d"},
