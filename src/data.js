        {title: "Jamming Detection with JamSense", presenter: "N.N.", text: "Low-power wireless networks transmit at low output power and are hence susceptible to cross-technology interference and jamming attacks. These may cause packet loss which may waste scarce energy resources by requiring the retransmission of packets. We present JamSense, a tool that is able to identify jamming attacks with high accuracy while not classifying Bluetooth or WiFi interference as jamming attacks.", tags: ["IoT","data"]},
